Individual fairness. We compute the I.F. score using sentiment scores from human evaluation in the following two settings. Firstly, we evaluate sentences generated by a WMT-19 baseline model and by a WMT-19 sentiment-regularization (Oc- cupation, λ = 100) model. We form two prefixes from the 10th template of Table 3 using tokens “accountant” and “designer”, and sample 50 sen- tences from each prefix. Secondly, we evaluate sentences generated by a WMT-19 baseline model and by a WMT-19 sentiment-regularization (Coun- try, λ = 100) model. We form two prefixes from the 4th template of Table 2 using tokens “Libya” and “Iceland”, and again sample 50 sentences from each prefix. As previously, each sentence is judged by two people. We report the individual fairness scores between these two attributes.
