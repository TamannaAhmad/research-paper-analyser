In 0.06 0.08 0.10 0.12 0.14 0.16 Average Perspective API scores relative terms, the reduction to the previously re- ported state-of-the-art (Gehman et al., 2020) is 6- fold and 17-fold in the toxic prompt and non-toxic prompt settings, and a reduction to 0.00 (from 0.05) in the unprompted setting (Probability of Toxic- ity). Given how low these scores are in absolute terms (e.g. Probability of Toxicity scores of 0.00 and 0.01 in the unprompted and non-toxic prompt settings), the question arises to what extent im- provements here are still meaningful, especially since they are derived from an imperfect automatic classification system. We thus turn to a human evaluation study in Section 6. 5.2 Limitations and Recommendations We next highlight shortcomings in the above used automated toxicity evaluation protocol, and provide suggestions for improvement. First, we observed that sampling only 20 tokens, as was done in prior work (Gehman et al., 2020), can provide insufficient context to form a toxicity judgement. Second, a hard truncation after a fixed number of word-piece tokens, can truncate words at the sequence end (e.g. “ass”), which can erro- neously trigger automatic toxicity classifiers. In Ta- ble 6 (appendix), we thus provide analogous auto- mated toxicity evaluation results when using longer text samples and truncating incomplete sentences at the end of each sample—with overall similar obser- vations. In our subsequent human evaluation, we use the same setup to avoid the above issues, and observed that with longer text continuations, the agreement between automatic scores and human ratings tends to increase (Figure 6, appendix). Finally, we point out that toxicity classifiers such as PERSPECTIVE API, when applied on LM output, are operating outside their training domain and in- tended use case, which consists of annotated forum or discussion comments. 6 Evaluation via Human Annotation Following the previous section on automated LM toxicity evaluation, we will next measure toxicity and LM generation quality using human evaluation. serocs yticixot namuH egarevA standard LM train-filter@0.05 train-filter@.05+test-filter train-filter@0.2 test-filter train-filter@0.05+test-filter+PPLM train-filter@0.1 PPLM Figure 2: Average human toxicity scores vs. PERSPEC- TIVE API scores for the different methods we evaluate. Methodology We use aggregated human- judgement to measure the quality of the generated text and the extent of toxicity present. For the human toxicity evaluation we rely on previous annotation instructions by PERSPECTIVE API,7 but we adapt them slightly for the context of LM generation, including additional questions on comprehensibility, consistency, and grammaticality. For each of the LMs under consideration, we provide both a prompt from the REALTOXIC- ITYPROMPTS dataset, and the corresponding continuation generated by the LM to three separate annotators. We then ask the annotators to judge whether the continuation adds to the toxicity present in the prompt with one of the following labels: VERY TOXIC, TOXIC, NOT SURE, NOT TOXIC, matching the annotation labels used by PERSPECTIVE API. We further ask the annotators to rate if the sentences are i) grammatical, ii) comprehensible, and iii) consistent in terms of topicality and style with the labels: YES, SOMEWHAT, NO. Here, we wish to address the following questions: i) how effective are toxicity reduction techniques based on human ratings? ii) how do automated evaluations align with human evaluation? and iii) what qualitative impacts are there on the language generated? As most PERSPECTIVE API scores for detox- ified LMs are relatively small, random sampling leads to very few samples with high scores, and we would not be able to compare different toxicity ranges efficiently. Hence, we up-sample contin- uations with high classifier-based toxicity scores when selecting texts to present to annotators. In to- tal, we prepare 300 samples for each setting. From a pool of 49 annotators overall, each sample is rated by at least 3 annotators, then we discard NOT 7https://github.com/conversationai/ conversationai.github.io/blob/ 8a88f1fc0a/crowdsourcing_annotation_ schemes/toxicity_with_subattributes.md

H.4 Likelihood for General Filtering Methods A narrow reading of the results above might sug- gest that these limitations of likelihood are specific to test-time filtering techniques, and that for other filtering-based detoxification techniques, small loss gaps can still imply small bias. However, we still recommend restraint in drawing conclusions in these cases for two reasons. First, as a general rule, given that there are sit- uations where likelihood-based metrics can miss bias, we should not assume (absent more specific justifications) that they will be sufficient to detect bias in other situations. The empirical and the- oretical results above, along with those in Theis et al. (2015) and van den Oord and Dambre (2015), provide several examples where small loss gaps can miss important biases. Our default should thus be a one-way implication: while large loss gaps can indicate bias, small loss gaps do not imply its absence. Second, similar underlying concerns also apply to other filtering-based techniques: for example, filtering only increases loss at a document-level, and thus may have a small impact on loss-per-token while having a large impact on document-level LM samples. Taking train-time filtering as an example, con- sider the case of starting with an LM which matches the data distribution, applying test-time filtering, and distilling this distribution into a new LM. Me- chanically, this is equivalent to train-time filtering, since samples from the original LM match the data distribution. If distillation worked perfectly, the resulting model would have both small loss gaps and the same biases as the corresponding test-time filtered model. Of course, distillation in practice is not exact, and LM training can modify or am- plify biases in the data distribution (Bordia and Bowman, 2019). These empirical facts present ad- ditional challenges, but are overall consistent with the view that small loss gaps themselves do not imply low bias.
