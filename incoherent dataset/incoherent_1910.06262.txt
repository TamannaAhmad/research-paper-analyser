Epigraphy is the study of doc- uments, ‚Äúinscriptions‚Äù, written on a durable sur- face (stone, ceramic, metal) by individuals, groups and institutions of the past (Davies and Wilkes, 2012). Only a small minority of surviving inscrip- tions are fully legible and complete, as many have been damaged in time (Figure 1).

PYTHIA has been trained on ancient Greek (hence- forth, "AG") inscriptions, written in the ancient Greek language between 7th century BCE and 5th 2 Related work century CE. We chose AG epigraphy as a case computer vision (NLP) has dealt with study for two reasons: a) the variability of contents tasks akin to text restoration. Indeed, standard and context of the AG epigraphic record makes it count-based n-gram language models (LM) share an excellent challenge for NLP; b) several digital with epigraphists the ‚Äúparallel-finding‚Äù approach.

A PYTHIA training parameters Both encoder and decoder of PYTHIA consist of 2-layers with 512 hidden units. During training, we use dropout with probability 0.2 and scheduled sampling with probability 0.5 (Bengio et al., 2015). All models were trained on an 8-core machine with an NVIDIA 1080 Ti graphics processing unit (GPU). The batch size was 32 and the network weights were optimised using Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2015) with a learning rate of 10‚àí3 and gradient clipping of 5. B LM training parameters The language modelling LSTM network consists of 2-layers with 1024 hidden units and an equally sized character embedding space. The parameters were trained using Adam with a learning rate of 2 ¬∑ 10‚àí3, a decay of 0.95, gradient norm clipping of 5, and dropout probability 0.2 for the inputs and the hidden layers.
